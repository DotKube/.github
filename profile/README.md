## üìä Architecture Overview

Below is a high-level architecture of a typical DotKube setup:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Laptop ["Laptop"]
        subgraph Cluster ["Local Kubernetes Cluster"]
            AspireDashboard["Aspire Dashboard"]
            BagetterApp["Bagetter"]
            SQLServerOperator["SQL Server Operator"]
            LocalDBs
            DotKubeUI["DotKube UI - Quickly create databases and manage resources"]
        end

        Local-Dotnet-App -- "Push Metrics" --> AspireDashboard
        EndUser -- "pushes nuget packages" --> BagetterApp
        Local-Dotnet-App -- "works with" --> LocalDBs
        EndUser -- "Interacts With" --> DotKubeUI --> SQLServerOperator
    end

    SQLServerOperator --> LocalDBs
```

This diagram illustrates:

- The **Laptop** hosting the **Local Kubernetes Cluster**.
- Components within the cluster like:
  - **Aspire Dashboard** for metrics and visualization.
  - **Bagetter**, a NuGet package app.
  - **SQL Server Operator** managing local databases.
  - **DotKube UI** for database creation and resource management.
- Interactions between:
  - **Local .NET Apps** pushing metrics to **Aspire Dashboard** and working with local databases.
  - **End Users** interacting with **Bagetter** and **DotKube UI**, which integrates with the **SQL Server Operator**.
