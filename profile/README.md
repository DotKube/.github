## üìä Architecture Overview

DotKube simplifies local development and Kubernetes management by integrating various tools and workflows into an intuitive architecture. Below are visual representations of key components and their interactions.

---

### **Azure Service Emulators**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Laptop ["Laptop"]
        subgraph Cluster ["Local Kubernetes Cluster"]
            ServiceBus["Azure Service Bus Emulator"]
            EventHubs["Azure Event Hubs Emulator"]
            CosmosDB["Azure Cosmos DB Emulator"]
            Azurite["Azurite (Azure Storage Emulator)"]
        end

        EndUser["End User"]
        DotNetApp["Local DotNet App (Development)"]
    end

    EndUser -- "Writes" --> DotNetApp
    DotNetApp -- "Works With" --> ServiceBus
    DotNetApp -- "Works With" --> EventHubs
    DotNetApp -- "Works With" --> CosmosDB
    DotNetApp -- "Works With" --> Azurite
```

**Description:**  
This setup includes Azure service emulators running inside a local Kubernetes cluster. Developers write and run their .NET applications on their laptops, which interact with the emulated services for development purposes.

---

### **Databases**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Laptop ["Laptop"]
        subgraph Cluster ["Local Kubernetes Cluster"]
            SQLServerOperator["SQL Server Operator"]
            LocalDBs["'Local' Databases"]
            DAB["Data API Builder (HTTP API)"]
        end

        SQLServerOperator -- "Manages" --> LocalDBs
        SQLServerOperator -- "Manages" --> DAB
        Local-Dotnet-App -- "Works With" --> DAB
        Local-Dotnet-App -- "Works With" --> LocalDBs
        DAB -- "Works With" --> LocalDBs
    end
```

**Description:**  
This architecture features a SQL Server Operator managing local databases and a Data API Builder (DAB) for creating HTTP APIs. The local .NET app interacts with both the DAB and databases for streamlined development.

---

### **DotKube CLI - Image Generator**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Laptop ["Laptop"]
        EndUser["End User"]
        DotKubeCLI["DotKube CLI"]
        LocalDotNetApp["Local DotNet App"]
    end

    DotNetAppImage["Container Image for DotNet App"]
    LocalRegistry["Local Registry"]
    ContainerRegistry["Container Registry"]

    EndUser -- "Works With" --> LocalDotNetApp
    LocalDotNetApp -- "Wrapper for dotnet publish" --> DotKubeCLI
    DotKubeCLI -- "Builds" --> DotNetAppImage
    DotNetAppImage -- "Pushes To" --> LocalRegistry
    DotNetAppImage -- "Pushes To" --> ContainerRegistry
```

**Description:**  
The DotKube CLI streamlines the containerization of .NET applications. It wraps around `dotnet publish` to create container images, which are then pushed to a local or remote container registry.

---

### **Local Registry**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Laptop ["Laptop"]
        subgraph Cluster ["Local Kind Cluster"]
        end
        LocalRegistry["Local Registry"]
    end
    CR["Container Registry"]

    LocalRegistry -- "Pulls From" --> CR
    Cluster -- "Pulls Images From" --> LocalRegistry
```

**Description:**  
The local Kubernetes cluster uses a local registry to manage container images. The local registry syncs with an external container registry for pulling base images.

---

### **NuGet Packages**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Laptop ["Laptop"]
        subgraph Cluster ["Local Kubernetes Cluster"]
            BagetterApp["Bagetter"]
            DotKubeUI["DotKube UI/CLI"]
        end

        Local-Dotnet-App -- "Pulls nuget packages from" --> BagetterApp
        EndUser -- "Pushes NuGet packages" --> BagetterApp
        DotKubeUI -- "Manages" --> BagetterApp
        EndUser -- "Works on" --> Local-Dotnet-App

    end

    NuGet["Official NuGet Feed"]
    BagetterApp -- "Pulls From" --> NuGet
```

**Description:**  
The Bagetter application in the cluster manages NuGet packages. Developers pull packages for their local .NET applications from Bagetter, which itself syncs with the official NuGet feed.

---

### **Self-Hosted Pipelines**

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Laptop ["Laptop"]
        subgraph Cluster ["Local/Remote Cluster"]
            PipelineAgents["Self-Hosted Pipeline Agents"]
        end
        EndUser["End User"]
    end

    EndUser -- "Uses" --> AzureDevOps["Azure DevOps"]
    AzureDevOps -- "Manages Jobs On" --> PipelineAgents
```

**Description:**  
Self-hosted pipeline agents are deployed within a Kubernetes cluster, allowing Azure DevOps to manage jobs locally or remotely. This setup gives developers full control over their CI/CD workflows.

---

### Description

This architecture includes:

- **Laptop**: The development environment hosting the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Local Kubernetes Cluster**: A cluster running:
  - **Aspire Dashboard**: Visualizing application metrics.
  - **Bagetter**: A NuGet package management app.
  - **SQL Server Operator**: Managing SQL Server instances.
  - **Local Databases**: Databases managed by the operator or other tools.
  - **DotKube UI**: A UI to simplify database creation and resource management.
- **Interactions**:
  - **Local .NET Apps**: Push metrics to Aspire Dashboard and interact with local databases.
  - **End Users**: Interact with Bagetter for package management and DotKube UI for resource operations.
